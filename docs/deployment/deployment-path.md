# The deployment path: making a box reproducible

**Applies to:** a long-lived deployment (the `hermes-systest` ECS box running
the gateway and its sidecars as systemd services), not laptop installs.

## The gap

A deployment is more than its checkout. Code was already reproducible — the
tree comes from `develop`, packages are exact-pinned, and the interpreter has
a declared floor watched weekly (`docs/deployment/runtime-drift.md`).
Everything that makes the box *that* deployment was not:

| Layer | Lived only on the box | Rebuild without this doc |
|---|---|---|
| `config.yaml` — MCP servers, approval gates, model/memory wiring | yes | agent comes back with no tools and no approval gating |
| `.env` — the credentials | yes | nothing authenticates |
| 13 systemd units + 12 drop-ins — the unprivileged `hermes` model | yes | services run as root, or not at all |
| Interactive credentials — Google, WhatsApp, Canva/Railway/Vercel OAuth | yes | integrations silently dead |
| `deploy-hermes.sh` — the deploy tool itself | yes, untracked | no way to deploy |

Two distinct failures came out of that. A rebuilt box could not be brought
back without archaeology; and a change to any of it — by an operator, by a
deploy step, or by the agent itself acting on an instruction from a message —
left no trace anywhere a reviewer would look. The second is the one that
prompted this work: a runtime that drifts from what the repo says while every
dashboard reports healthy.

## What owns what

```
repo (public)                       scripts/deploy_state.py     the tooling
                                    deploy/hermes-deploy.sh     the deploy tool
private state repo                  <deployment>/config.snapshot.yaml
  ai-prentice-4-all-deploy-state    <deployment>/state.manifest.yaml
  on the box: /opt/data/hermes-deploy-state
                                    <deployment>/systemd/*
box, root-only                      /opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env
box, hermes-only                    $HERMES_HOME/.env, credential files
```

**The snapshot holds no credentials** — every secret value is replaced by a
`${PLACEHOLDER}` and the values live in one root-owned file on the box. It
still describes a box in detail (account names, service layout, which
identities are enrolled), and this repo is public, so the state store is
**not** committed here; `.gitignore` blocks it and `--state-root` points the
tool at a private location. The tooling and this document are generic and
belong in the repo.

## Why `check` never writes

Hermes rewrites `config.yaml` itself — `/model` from Telegram, `hermes tools`,
`hermes setup`, memory setup, roughly 30 call sites. A scheme where the repo
is authoritative and a deploy step overwrites the file would silently discard
a change made from a phone.

So the box stays authoritative and divergence becomes a *report*:

| Command | Direction | When |
|---|---|---|
| `capture` | box → state store | after any deliberate change; review the diff |
| `check` | compares, writes nothing | weekly timer, and after every deploy |
| `render` | state store → a config.yaml | rebuilding a box. Never scheduled |

## Everyday use

All commands run from the checkout on the box (`/opt/data/hermes-agent`) with
the deployment's interpreter. `PY` and `STATE` below are:

```bash
PY=/opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python
STATE=/opt/data/hermes-deploy-state
```

### After changing anything on the box

```bash
sudo $PY scripts/deploy_state.py --state-root $STATE capture \
  --deployment hermes-systest \
  --hermes-home /opt/data/hermes-home-staging \
  --deploy-script /opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh \
  --secrets-out /opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env \
  --credential-glob 'google-workspace/credentials/*.json' \
  --credential-glob 'whatsapp/session-*/creds.json' \
  --credential-glob 'mcp-tokens/*.json'
```

Then commit the diff in the state store. `git diff` there is the review: it
names the MCP server that appeared, the approval pattern that changed, the
tool that was enabled.

`capture` **refuses to write** if credential material survives sanitization
(`find_leaks`), so a heuristic miss fails the run instead of committing a
token.

### Checking for drift

```bash
$PY scripts/deploy_state.py --state-root $STATE check --deployment hermes-systest
```

Exit `0` clean, `1` drift, `2` unreadable. `--json` for machine-readable
findings, `--notify` to send Telegram **only** when drift is found — so
silence is meaningful, matching `check_runtime_drift.py`.

What counts as drift: a config key added, removed or changed; a `.env` key the
manifest requires that is now missing; a credential file gone or with looser
permissions; an installed unit whose bytes changed; the installed deploy
script differing from the reviewed copy in the repo.

What deliberately does **not**: rotating a secret in place (values are
placeholders), or adding a new `.env` key — that is a `note` saying "capture
this", not a failure. A check that cries wolf gets ignored.

### Deploying code

```bash
sudo deploy/hermes-deploy.sh [branch]     # default: develop
```

Fetches through the root-owned read-only deploy key
(`docs/deployment/deploy-credential.md`), aborts on unexpected local
modifications, backs up known ones, reinstalls the package, re-asserts
ownership (`hermes` owns the tree, root owns `.venv`), restarts every unit and
verifies each came back active.

The copy in the repo is the reviewed source of truth; the installed copy at
`/opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh` is compared against it by `check`. After editing
it, reinstall and re-capture:

```bash
sudo install -m 755 -o root -g root deploy/hermes-deploy.sh /opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh
```

Root-owned and **not** `0700`: what matters is that `hermes` cannot *write* it
(it runs as root and chowns the tree). The weekly check runs as `hermes` and
hashes this file, and its contents are in the public repo anyway, so denying
read buys nothing and costs the verification. A file the checking user cannot
read is reported as an unverified-layer note rather than crashing the run.

## Rebuilding a box from nothing

Ordered, and the order matters — services fail to start if credentials are not
in place first.

1. **Provision** the instance and install the OS prerequisites
   (`git`, `uv`, `nodejs` for the WhatsApp bridges, `caddy` if the dashboard is
   exposed).
2. **Deploy key**: recreate the root-owned read-only key and the
   `github-hermes-deploy` SSH alias per `docs/deployment/deploy-credential.md`.
   Clone `develop` to `/opt/data/hermes-agent`.
3. **Service user**: `useradd --system --home /opt/data/hermes-user hermes`.
   Build the venv (`uv venv .venv --python 3.11 && uv sync --frozen`), then
   `chown -R hermes:hermes` the tree except `.venv`, which stays root-owned —
   root runs `pip` from it, so a `hermes`-writable venv is a path back to root.
4. **Clone the private state store** to `$STATE` and restore the secrets file
   to `/opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env` (`0600`, root):
   ```bash
   sudo git clone github-hermes-state:<owner>/ai-prentice-4-all-deploy-state.git $STATE
   sudo chmod -R a+rX $STATE          # check runs as hermes; no secrets in here
   sudo git config --system --add safe.directory $STATE
   ```
   This needs a **second, separate** read-only deploy key — deploy keys are
   per-repo — created and aliased exactly like the source one
   (`docs/deployment/deploy-credential.md`), as `/root/.ssh/hermes_state_deploy`
   behind `Host github-hermes-state`. Read-only on purpose: captures are
   reviewed and pushed from an operator session, never straight from the box, so
   a compromised box cannot rewrite the record of what it is supposed to look
   like. Verify with `sudo git push --dry-run origin main`, which must be
   refused.

   The secrets file is **not** in the repo and has no backup here — restore it
   from your credential backup, or `render` will tell you exactly which
   placeholders it is missing.
5. **Render the config**:
   ```bash
   sudo $PY scripts/deploy_state.py --state-root $STATE render \
     --deployment hermes-systest \
     --secrets /opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env \
     --out /opt/data/hermes-home-staging/config.yaml
   sudo chown hermes:hermes /opt/data/hermes-home-staging/config.yaml
   ```
6. **Restore `.env` and the credential files from the offsite backup** — one
   step for both, since one bundle holds them:
   ```bash
   $PY scripts/backup_secrets.py restore \
     --bundle /opt/data/hermes-deploy-backups/hermes-systest/<newest>.tar.gz.age \
     --identity ~/hermes-backup-key.txt --out /tmp/restore
   ```
   `restore` writes under `--out` with the recorded modes and owners, never
   over the live paths; copy them into place from there. The private key is not
   on the box by design (see *Offsite backup* below) — this step needs the
   operator's key from the password manager.

   Without the bundle, `.env` has to be re-entered key by key from the
   manifest's `env_keys`, `0600` and `hermes`-owned; `render` does not produce
   it, because `.env` is secrets only and the manifest carries key *names*
   rather than values.
7. **Anything the bundle did not hold** is listed in the manifest's
   `credential_files` with its required owner and mode. Google Workspace tokens
   can be regenerated by re-running consent
   (`custom/calendar/calendar_auth.py`, see
   `optional-mcps/google-workspace/manifest.yaml`). WhatsApp sessions cannot be
   restored from nothing — a lost `session-*/creds.json` means re-pairing the
   phone.
8. **Install the units** from `$STATE/hermes-systest/systemd/` into
   `/etc/systemd/system/` (drop-in directories included), then
   `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl enable --now 'hermes-*'`.
9. **Restore data**: `state.db` (sessions, memory) from
   `/opt/data/backups/`. Config makes the agent work; this is what makes it
   remember. It is not part of the state store — it is a database, and backups
   own it.
10. **Verify**:
    ```bash
    $PY scripts/deploy_state.py --state-root $STATE check --deployment hermes-systest
    $PY scripts/check_runtime_drift.py
    systemctl list-units 'hermes-*' --no-pager
    ```
    A clean `check` means this box matches the one that was working. Expect
    `NRestarts=0` on every unit.

## Weekly check

The interpreter check already runs weekly; the state check is a second
`ExecStart` on the same unit rather than a new timer, so one report covers all
four layers:

It is added as a drop-in so the captured base unit stays byte-identical —
editing the unit itself would show up as drift against the snapshot on the very
next run:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/hermes-drift-check.service.d/10-deploy-state.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python \
    /opt/data/hermes-agent/scripts/deploy_state.py \
    --state-root /opt/data/hermes-deploy-state check \
    --deployment hermes-systest --notify
```

A `[Service]` drop-in *appends* `ExecStart` lines rather than replacing them,
so the interpreter check still runs first.

`SuccessExitStatus=0 1` is already set — drift is reported by `--notify`, and a
non-zero exit is the signal, not a fault. Systemd runs sequential `ExecStart`
lines in order and stops at the first *failure*, which is why the tolerated
exit status matters here: without it, drift in the interpreter check would
prevent the state check from running at all.

The service runs as `hermes`, so everything `check` reads must be readable by
that user: the state store (root-owned, `0755` — it contains no secrets) and
the installed deploy script. The secrets file is not read by `check` at all and
stays `0600` under a `0700` directory.

A state store that cannot be read at all is exit `2` and a real unit failure —
"I could not check" must never look like "nothing has changed".

## Offsite backup

`render` needs a secrets file, and `restore` needs credential files, and
neither is something the repo may hold. Until this existed the only copies were
on the live disk — with the "backups" beside them on that same volume, which is
no backup at all. `scripts/backup_secrets.py` closes it:

```bash
sudo $PY scripts/backup_secrets.py backup --deployment hermes-systest \
  --state-root $STATE --repo /opt/data/hermes-deploy-backups \
  --recipient age1... --push
```

The bundle is a tar of `.env`, every `credential_files` entry and the secrets
file, streamed through `age` to a **public** recipient and committed to a
private repo. Three properties matter, and all three are asserted in
`tests/scripts/test_backup_secrets.py`:

- **The box cannot read its own backups.** It holds an `age1...` recipient, not
  a private key. That key lives in the operator's password manager, and losing
  it means losing the backups — a deliberate trade against a box that reads
  untrusted WhatsApp and email being able to decrypt every secret it ever had.
- **Plaintext never lands on disk.** The tar is built in memory and piped into
  `age` on stdin, so a failed run leaves nothing behind to shred.
- **What to back up comes from the manifest**, not a hardcoded list, so a
  credential added to the deployment is covered as soon as it is captured.

The backup repo is **separate from the state store** because the box needs
*write* access to push bundles, and a deploy key grants that over a whole repo.
If backups lived in the state repo, a compromised box could rewrite the
snapshot it is being measured against. Split in two, it can add ciphertext it
cannot read and still cannot touch the record used to detect its own drift.

Only a changed secret set produces a new bundle: the index carries one
aggregate digest, and an unchanged set is skipped, so the history shows *when a
secret changed* instead of one commit per night. The index records paths and
that digest — modes and owners travel inside the ciphertext, since the
permissions of credential files are a map of what to attack.

Daily, from its own timer (a backup wants to be fresher than a weekly report):

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/hermes-secret-backup.service — runs as root, needs .env
[Service]
Type=oneshot
EnvironmentFile=/opt/data/deploy/backup-recipient.env
ExecStart=/opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python \
    /opt/data/hermes-agent/scripts/backup_secrets.py \
    --state-root /opt/data/hermes-deploy-state \
    --repo /opt/data/hermes-deploy-backups \
    backup --deployment hermes-systest --push
```

And `verify` joins the weekly report as a third `ExecStart`, so a timer that
quietly stopped is reported rather than assumed:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/hermes-drift-check.service.d/20-backup-verify.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python \
    /opt/data/hermes-agent/scripts/backup_secrets.py \
    --state-root /opt/data/hermes-deploy-state \
    --repo /opt/data/hermes-deploy-backups \
    verify --deployment hermes-systest --max-age-days 8 --notify
```

`verify` reads the index and the ciphertext header only — no plaintext — so it
runs as the unprivileged `hermes` user with the rest of the weekly check. It
reports a missing bundle, a stale one, a bundle that is somehow *not* encrypted,
and any credential on the box that no bundle covers.

Restoring, and the point of testing it before you need it:

```bash
$PY scripts/backup_secrets.py restore --bundle <file>.tar.gz.age \
  --identity ~/hermes-backup-key.txt --out /tmp/restore-probe
```

## Responding to a drift report

1. **Read the finding.** It names a dotted config path, an env key, a
   credential file or a unit.
2. **Decide which side is right.** A change you or the agent made on purpose:
   `capture` and commit. A change nobody intended: that is the interesting
   case — investigate before reverting, because "the agent enabled an MCP
   server" and "an approval pattern disappeared" are security events, not
   configuration noise.
3. **To revert**, render the snapshot to a scratch path and diff it against
   the live file before copying anything over. Never render straight onto
   `config.yaml` on a running box — you will lose any legitimate change made
   since the last capture.
4. **Restart** only what the change affects. `config.yaml` is read at
   process start, so a config revert needs `systemctl restart hermes-gateway`.

## Limits, stated plainly

- **This is not infrastructure-as-code.** It does not create the instance,
  install packages, or configure Caddy. It captures and restores the
  deployment's *state*, which is the part that was undocumented.
- **A capture is only as fresh as the last run.** Between captures the box can
  diverge; the weekly check is what bounds how long that goes unnoticed.
- **Sanitization is heuristic.** `find_leaks` is the backstop that turns a miss
  into a failed run rather than a committed secret, and
  `tests/scripts/test_deploy_state.py` pins both properties. Review a snapshot
  diff before committing it anyway.
- **Data is out of scope.** `state.db`, session history and WhatsApp message
  stores are not in the bundle: they are large, they change constantly, and
  they are not what makes a rebuild impossible. Full-disk ECS snapshots are the
  right tool for those, and are not set up.
- **The backup is only as good as the private key.** Public-key encryption
  means the box cannot help you if the key is lost. Test a restore
  occasionally; a backup nobody has ever decrypted is a belief, not a backup.
