Written for an agent or engineer picking this up cold, with no session history.
It states what exists, what is verified, what is *not*, and where the detail
lives. The per-topic documents are authoritative for procedure; this file is
authoritative for **what is currently true of the live box**.

Last verified: 2026-08-17, application at `fed034fa4` (what the box runs; the
repo moves ahead of it — the box is deployed by whoever merges, not by this
document).

That line is **checked**, not a promise: `deploy_state.py handover` reports this
document as stale once anything it describes — `deploy/`, `deploy_state.py`,
`backup_secrets.py`, `check_runtime_drift.py` — changes after the document was
last written. The deploy prints the result and the weekly timer reports it. It
went three deploys stale before that existed.

Staleness is deliberately *not* "this sha is not HEAD": every deploy moves HEAD,
so that fires on every deploy forever — including the deploy shipping the doc
update, whose merge sha cannot be known while the doc is being written — and an
always-red check gets muted, which is how this document went stale in the first
place. Being a few feature commits behind HEAD is the document's *normal* state
and says nothing at all: it was a note until 2026-08-16, and that note printed
on every deploy for four days to report that nothing was wrong — amber that
never turns green is read as background colour, and the drift finding prints on
the same line. The one behind-HEAD case still reported is a documented revision
this history does not contain, which means the doc was verified against a
different line of development and its claims cannot be placed at all.

Re-verify the claims below before moving the line forward: a fresh date on stale
prose is worse than an old date.

## The box

```
instance      hermes-systest  (i-j6c81aisv2dd8mg17yle, cn-hongkong, ecs.e-c1m4.xlarge)
service user  hermes          (unprivileged; nothing Hermes runs is root)
interpreter   /opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python  — Python 3.11.15
age           1.1.1  (/usr/bin/age)
```

Paths, and which of them are reproducible:

```
/opt/data/hermes-agent            application checkout      git, `develop`
  agent-home/agent-home.env       the phone app's secrets   0600, git-ignored, backups only
/opt/data/hermes-home-staging     HERMES_HOME               config in state repo, secrets in backups
/opt/data/hermes-user             hermes user home
/opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh        the deploy tool           deploy/hermes-deploy.sh in git
/opt/data/deploy/                 root-only, 0700
  state-secrets.env               deployment secret values  offsite backup only
  backup-recipient.env            the age public recipient   not secret; recreate from the key
/opt/data/hermes-deploy-state     sanitized state, read-only clone
/opt/data/hermes-deploy-backups   encrypted bundles, write clone
/opt/data/backups                 old manual snapshots — NOT a backup system, see below
```

Three git remotes, three separate deploy keys, exactly one of which may write:

```
leolau/ai-prentice-4-all                  public   source        read-only key
leolau/ai-prentice-4-all-deploy-state     private  what the box should look like   read-only key
leolau/ai-prentice-4-all-deploy-backups   private  age ciphertext                  WRITE key
```

The state key is read-only deliberately: a box that could push would be able to
rewrite the record used to detect its own drift. The backup key must write, which
is why the bundles are in a different repository from the state — a deploy key
cannot be scoped to a subdirectory.

## What runs

15 long-running services, all as `hermes` — which was untrue for a day, see
below:

```
hermes-gateway        hermes-dashboard      hermes-digest        hermes-escalation
hermes-wa-bridge-personal    hermes-wa-bridge-connectar   hermes-wa-batcher    hermes-wa-triage
hermes-email-poller   hermes-email-batcher  hermes-email-triage  hermes-embed
hermes-calendar-poller       hermes-calendar-triage
agent-home            (the phone PWA — note the name, see below)
```

`hermes-calendar-triage` ran as **root** from 2026-08-11 to 2026-08-12: it was
installed by hand, its unit was in no repository, and the 2026-07-31
de-privileging drop-ins could not cover a unit that did not exist yet. Nothing
reported it — `deploy_state.py check` walked the snapshot's units and never
asked the box what *else* was installed, so a unit the snapshot had never seen
was invisible by construction. Both calendar units and a
`10-unprivileged.conf` for the triage agent are now captured state, and
`deploy/hermes-calendar-triage.service` exists so a rebuild does not repeat it.

**That blind spot is closed as of 2026-08-16** (#272): `check` enumerates the
box with the manifest's own `unit_globs` and reports every installed unit *and
drop-in* the snapshot does not contain, naming the account it would run as
(`runs as root (no User=)` when it declares none). It was found the same way it
was born — two new `hermes-review-pass` units sat on the box uncaptured and the
check said "no drift". A unit installed by hand is no longer outside every
check we have, but it is still outside the *reviewed* one until someone captures
it: the finding is drift, and capture is the fix.

`hermes-calendar-poller` was installed on 2026-08-11. Before that only the
triage half of the calendar pipeline had a unit, so nothing fetched events:
`calendar_events` sat empty for weeks and the Inbox showed no meetings. Its
OAuth comes from the Workspace MCP credential store rather than `GCAL_*`
environment variables — see `CALENDAR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

`hermes-embed` is the loopback embedding service the layer-4 memory tier calls;
see `local-embeddings.md`.

**`agent-home` is the one service not named `hermes-*`**, which is exactly how it
spent ten days invisible: until FG-23 phase A0 (2026-08-05) it ran as **root**
from a *second clone* (`/opt/data/agent-home-app`, frozen at PR #62, serving a
build from 2026-07-27) that the deploy never entered and the `hermes-*` capture
glob could not see. Now:

```
unit         agent-home.service   User=hermes, ProtectSystem=strict, ProtectHome=yes
WorkingDir   /opt/data/hermes-agent/agent-home     the main checkout
public       https://home.leolau.ai-and-i.io → Caddy → 127.0.0.1:3100
build        deploy rebuilds it when agent-home/ or package-lock.json moves
capture      DEFAULT_UNIT_GLOBS = ("hermes-*", "agent-home*")
```

It serves a *compiled* Next.js bundle, so a source change that is not rebuilt is
invisible however green the deploy looks; `agent-home/.next/BUILD_ID` mtime is
the tell. It is an npm **workspace** of the root `package.json` — install and
build from the repo root (`npm ci && npm run build --workspace agent-home`), never
from inside `agent-home/`, which would create a second unhoisted dep tree.

Four timers:

```
hermes-drift-check.timer         Mondays 09:00   three checks, reports only on drift
hermes-secret-backup.timer       daily 04:30     encrypted credential backup, pushes
hermes-memory-projection.timer   daily 03:00     refits the memory explorer's 2-D map
hermes-review-pass.timer         Mondays 08:00   the learning loop's review moment
```

The review pass is the clock for FG-29/FG-30/FG-31: it generates the monthly
profile suggestion, alerts on sibling-goal conflicts and delivers the weekly
digest as a notification. Until it existed, every one of those outputs was
reachable only by someone typing a command, so on this box none of them was
ever produced — `generate_suggestion()`'s only caller was the interactive CLI.
Generation self-gates to monthly inside the function, so the timer is weekly and
the digest's dedupe key is the ISO week.

The projection fit is a whole-corpus SVD, so it can never run in a page
request; without the timer the map would keep showing the corpus as it was the
day someone last ran the command by hand, and every memory written since would
be counted as "N new" and drawn nowhere.

The weekly unit runs four `ExecStart` lines in order, added as drop-ins so the
captured base unit stays byte-identical:

1. `check_runtime_drift.py` — interpreter and package baseline
2. `deploy_state.py check` — config, `.env` key names, credential modes, the
   captured units, and any `hermes-*`/`agent-home*` unit or drop-in installed
   on the box that the snapshot has never seen
3. `backup_secrets.py verify` — backup freshness, coverage, and that it is
   actually *offsite*
4. `deploy_state.py handover --notify` — whether this document still describes
   the deployed revision

Confirm the drop-in set with `systemctl cat hermes-drift-check.service`; the
fourth line is captured state like the others. It was written on 2026-08-05 but
only *installed* on 2026-08-12 — for a week this document described a check the
box was not running, which is the same failure one level up. A drop-in is
installed when it appears in `systemctl cat`, not when it is merged.

`SuccessExitStatus=0 1` matters: drift is signalled by exit 1, and without it
drift in the first check would stop the other two from running. Silence means
clean — a report only arrives on Telegram when something is wrong.

## The three layers, and the one question each answers

```
runtime drift    "is the interpreter/packages what we pinned?"
state check      "does this box still match the reviewed record of itself?"
backup verify    "if this box vanished, could we rebuild it?"
```

The state check is the answer to the original problem: a hand-edit to
`config.yaml` — by an operator, a deploy step, or the agent acting on an
instruction in a message — now shows up as a weekly finding instead of being
invisible. It never overwrites, because Hermes rewrites its own `config.yaml`
from ~30 call sites and a render-on-deploy scheme would silently discard a change
made from Telegram.

## Reproducing the box from nothing

Full steps are in `deployment-path.md` ("Cold rebuild"). The shape:

1. Clone the source over its deploy key, `develop`.
2. Clone the state repo over *its* deploy key (`git config --system --add
   safe.directory` on it, or root-owned clone lookups fail for `hermes`).
3. `deploy_state.py render` the config from the snapshot plus the secrets file.
4. Restore `.env` and every interactive credential from the newest bundle in the
   backup repo — needs the private age key, which is not on the box.
5. Install the captured systemd units and drop-ins, `daemon-reload`, enable.
6. Run all three checks. A clean result means this box matches the working one.

Steps 3 and 4 are the only ones that need something not in a repository: the
root-owned `state-secrets.env` (itself in the backup) and the private age key.

## What is verified, and what is not

Verified on the live box, not in a fixture. The list below is cumulative; the
lines re-checked at this verification (2026-08-16, `3900ed007`) are marked ✔:

- ✔ 15 enabled long-running units — the 14 `hermes-*` above plus `agent-home` —
  all `active`, and `systemctl show -p User` reads `hermes` for **every one of
  them**, including `agent-home` and both calendar units.
- ✔ Four enabled timers, matching the table above.
- ✔ `hermes-drift-check.service` has exactly the four `ExecStart` lines listed,
  in that order, with `User=hermes` and `SuccessExitStatus=0 1`.
- ✔ The state key still cannot push, and the box's clone has **no unpushed
  commits** — the two captures it made on 2026-08-15/16 were finished off-box
  and are now in the state repo.
- ✔ The installed deploy script is byte-identical to `deploy/hermes-deploy.sh`.
- ✔ A deploy removes what the new revision deleted or renamed away, and names
  any file left untracked in the checkout (silent when there are none).
- ✔ The checkout is clean: `git status --porcelain` is empty (the pre-fix
  orphan `docs/design/projects-feature-design.md` was cleared 2026-08-17).
- ✔ A deploy run from a stale installed copy says so.
- ✔ Interpreter Python 3.11.15, `age` 1.1.1.
- ✔ `datastore show` reports `app_prod` claimed by `/opt/data/hermes-home-staging`.
- ✔ An uncaptured unit and an uncaptured drop-in are each reported as drift,
  naming the account they would run as; capturing them clears it.
- `render` reproduces the live `config.yaml` byte-for-byte.
- The weekly unit completes as `hermes` with `Result=success`.
- The first bundle pushed: 17 files, 8.7 KB ciphertext, `age-encryption.org/v1`.
- An independent clone of the backup repo contains only the bundle and the index,
  and greps clean for `ghp_`, `GOCSPX`, `ya29`, `1//`, `AKIA`, `sk-`, the Telegram
  token, `postgresql://` and `AGE-SECRET`.
- `verify` reports drift — not success — when a bundle exists locally but the
  push failed. This was a real bug (#91); a local file next to the secrets it
  protects is not a backup.
- The memory explorer answers as the owner over a real dashboard session:
  `/summary`, `/rows`, `/projection` and `/documents` all 200, scoped to
  `leo_owner`, with the fitted PCA map returning its points.
- The phone app's memory page answers through its BFF as the owner: `/memory`
  200 (37 memories, 20 never recalled), `/api/memory/{rows,projection,query}`
  200, query placement returning 5 neighbours; every route 401 without a cookie
  and 401 with a one-byte-tampered one. Hermes tokens stay server-side.
- The deploy prints `deploy OK (<sha>)` and reports all 14 long-running units
  plus `agent-home`. Until 2026-08-05 it exited **3 on every successful deploy**
  and reported 2 of them: `hermes-*` matched the timer-invoked oneshots, and
  `is-active` on a finished oneshot exits 3 under `set -e` (#113). A deploy also
  no longer *runs* those oneshots — check their `ExecMainStartTimestamp` across a
  deploy.
- The `git fetch` is retried three times, and a persistent failure prints
  `FETCH FAILED after 3 attempts — nothing deployed, box unchanged at <sha>`
  (#210). One `github.com:22` connect timeout from `cn-hongkong` used to abort
  the deploy amid otherwise ordinary output, so a caller reading the tail could
  conclude a deploy had happened while the box never moved.
- Profile→schema isolation holds live (FG-27, 2026-08-12): a `--clone` reports
  the **shared** database with **distinct** schemas, three profiles query that
  one Postgres concurrently with disjoint `principals`, a profile pointed at
  another's schema is refused on connect, and `hermes datastore split-profile`
  moves a whole schema with verified row counts. Every box `hermes` invocation
  must pass `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data/hermes-home-staging`: unset, it resolves
  `$HOME/.hermes` — a real, empty, core-only home — and answers coherently about
  a deployment nobody uses (`datastore show` → "not configured").
- The map **renders** in a real browser (confirmed by Leo on the live phone URL,
  2026-08-05). This needed a human: `MemoryMap` fetches client-side, so server
  HTML contains no `<circle>` and `curl` cannot see a single dot — and the bug
  fixed in #112 was precisely a rendering-geometry one, drawing every point
  outside the SVG viewport. "The JSON is right" was not proof.

**The dashboard login subject must be aliased to a principal.** The basic-auth
provider mints sessions whose subject is the configured *username* (`admin`),
which is not a principal — so every principal-scoped page answered
`409 Authenticated, but no principal is enrolled for this user.` until:

```bash
hermes owner alias admin      # links the login subject to the owner principal
```

Identity lives in `app_prod` (`principals`, `principal_aliases`) regardless of
the datastore mode, because channels and the web surface share one identity
space; memories live in the *configured* mode's schema — `app_prod` since the
2026-08 prod-schema move (`datastore.mode: prod`, and `app_dev` still holds 109
older rows that the prod schema does not see). Both
facts are easy to trip over and neither is obvious from an error message.

**Not verified: nobody has decrypted a bundle.** The box holds only the public
recipient by design, so a restore can only be proved by the key holder. Until
someone runs the `restore` in `deployment-path.md` against a real bundle and
compares, "we have backups" is a belief. Do this periodically, not once.

## Known gaps, stated plainly

- **Data is not backed up.** The bundle holds credentials only. `state.db`,
  the layer-4 memory rows, the interaction ledger, session history and WhatsApp
  message archives are excluded — large, constantly
  changing, and not what makes a rebuild impossible. Full-disk ECS snapshots are
  the right tool and are **not** set up.
- **`/opt/data/backups` is not a backup system.** Manual snapshots, on the same
  volume as the live data, with no timer. As of 2026-08-03 it contained no
  credentials at all despite documentation once claiming otherwise. Do not rely
  on it; it is kept only as history.
- **A lost private age key is unrecoverable.** That is the deliberate trade for a
  box that reads untrusted WhatsApp and email being unable to decrypt its own
  backup history.
- **The weekly `verify` runs unprivileged**, so it reports the root-only secrets
  file as *unverified* rather than covered. The daily backup runs as root and
  does cover it — check the index if you need proof.
- **Alibaba OSS is unavailable** on this account (`ListBuckets` → `UserDisable`),
  which is why the offsite destination is a private GitHub repo.
- **Which units are supposed to be *running* is not captured state.** The
  snapshot holds unit files and drop-ins — their content — and `check` compares
  those plus anything installed the snapshot has never seen. Nothing records
  `is-enabled`/`is-active`, so on 2026-08-20 twelve units (gateway, digest,
  escalation, email, WhatsApp, calendar) were stopped **and disabled** for 21
  hours and the check reported no drift the whole time — while `agent-home`,
  the dashboard and the public URL kept answering 200, so no probe noticed
  either. `disabled` also means a reboot would not have restored them. Until
  the enabled/active set is captured and compared, a box visit must ask
  `systemctl is-enabled`/`is-active` per unit and never infer liveness from a
  port. See `pickup-2026-08-21.md`.
- **Only `hermes-systest` exists.** Everything is parameterized by
  `--deployment`, but no second deployment has ever been captured.
- **The box cannot publish its own state.** `capture` commits locally and the
  push fails ("marked as read only") — deliberate, so a compromised box cannot
  rewrite the record used to detect its drift. It is also silent: a state commit
  once sat unpushed for a whole deploy cycle, and two more did between 2026-08-15
  and 2026-08-16. Finish it off-box (`format-patch origin/main..main` → apply in
  a session clone → push → `reset --hard origin/main` on the box once the trees
  match) and confirm `git log origin/main..main` on the box is empty. It was
  empty at this verification.

## If you change anything on the box

```bash
PY=/opt/data/hermes-agent/.venv/bin/python
STATE=/opt/data/hermes-deploy-state
cd /opt/data/hermes-agent
sudo $PY scripts/deploy_state.py --state-root $STATE capture \
  --deployment hermes-systest \
  --hermes-home /opt/data/hermes-home-staging \
  --deploy-script /opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh \
  --secrets-out /opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env \
  --credential-glob 'google-workspace/credentials/*.json' \
  --credential-glob 'whatsapp/session-*/creds.json' \
  --credential-glob 'mcp-tokens/*.json'
```

Every argument is required: `capture` with a missing `--hermes-home` exits 2 and
writes nothing, so a state trail can quietly stop being updated. It did — no
capture ran between 2026-08-05 and 2026-08-12, and the weekly check answered
with 16 findings that were all just "nobody captured", which is exactly the
noise that gets a real finding ignored.

The other arguments used to fail the opposite way, which was worse. They decide
*coverage*, and a forgotten one exited 0: on 2026-08-16 a capture run without
`--credential-glob`, `--deploy-script` and `--secrets-out` dropped 15 credential
files and the deploy script's hash out of the record, and the next check
reported "no drift" about files it was no longer looking at. `capture` now
refuses to record less than the previous capture did, naming the argument that
went missing; `--allow-narrowing` is there for when the coverage is genuinely
gone rather than forgotten.

Then commit the diff in the state repo **from a session, not from the box** — the
box's key is read-only. The `git diff` there is the review: it names the MCP
server that appeared, the approval pattern that changed, the tool that was
enabled. Rotating a secret needs no capture; the daily backup notices the changed
content digest and writes a new bundle by itself.

Two rules worth restating because they are easy to break by accident: never
render straight onto a running box's `config.yaml`, and never give the box write
access to the state repo.

## Deploying a code change

The box has no SSH. Code deploys are driven from a local machine (or an agent
session) through the Alibaba Cloud CLI — `aliyun`, not the MCP OOS tool. The
MCP `OOS_RunCommand` path works too, but the CLI is simpler for a long-running
script and is what the deploy commands below use.

### Prerequisites

- `aliyun` CLI installed and configured (`aliyun configure`) with credentials
  that have ECS RunCommand permission on `cn-hongkong`.
- Git push access to `leolau/ai-prentice-4-all` (the `develop` branch requires
  pull requests — a direct `git push origin develop` is rejected by a repository
  rule).

### The full flow

```bash
# 1. Commit on a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
git add -p
git commit -m "feat(scope): what changed"
git push origin feat/my-feature

# 2. Open and merge a PR (develop requires it)
#    Via GitHub CLI: gh pr create --base develop ...
#    Or via the GitHub MCP tool: create_pull_request + merge_pull_request

# 3. Pull the merged develop locally
git checkout develop && git pull origin develop

# 4. Deploy — run the deploy script on the box via aliyun CLI
aliyun ecs RunCommand \
  --RegionId cn-hongkong \
  --InstanceId.1 i-j6c81aisv2dd8mg17yle \
  --Type RunShellScript \
  --CommandContent "/opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh develop 2>&1" \
  --Timeout 600
#    Returns: { "InvokeId": "t-hk..." }

# 5. Poll for results (the deploy takes 2-5 minutes)
sleep 180
aliyun ecs DescribeInvocationResults \
  --RegionId cn-hongkong \
  --InvokeId t-hk... 2>&1 | python3 -c '
import sys, json, base64
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
results = data.get("Invocation", {}).get("InvocationResults", {}).get("InvocationResult", [])
for r in results:
    output = r.get("Output", "")
    try: decoded = base64.b64decode(output).decode("utf-8", "replace")
    except: decoded = output
    print(f"ExitCode: {r.get("ExitCode", "?")}")
    print(decoded)
'
```

### What the deploy script does

`/opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh` (the reviewed copy in `deploy/hermes-deploy.sh`):

1. Checks for unexpected local modifications (aborts if any exist — a hotfix
   must never be silently clobbered).
2. Fetches `origin/develop` (three attempts, backing off) and fast-forwards; a
   fetch that never succeeds aborts with `nothing deployed, box unchanged`.
3. Deletes the files the new revision removed (`git diff --diff-filter=D
   --no-renames`), and lists any file left untracked in the checkout. Until
   2026-08-17 it did neither: `git checkout -f <ref> -- .` writes what the ref
   has and removes nothing it lacks, so every upstream delete or rename left its
   old file on the box forever — found as a `docs/design/projects-feature-design.md`
   that #283's rename should have taken away.
4. `pip install -e .` (reinstalls the package).
5. Rebuilds the dashboard bundle (`web/`) only when `web/` changed.
6. Rebuilds the agent-home bundle only when `agent-home/` or `package-lock.json`
   changed — this is a `next build` with full TypeScript type checking, which
   is stricter than vitest's esbuild and will catch type errors vitest misses.
7. Fixes ownership (`hermes:hermes` for source, `root:root` for `.venv`).
8. Restarts all enabled `hermes-*` services + `agent-home`.
9. Sleeps 15s, then verifies every unit is `active`.
10. Prints `deploy OK (<sha>)` or exits 1 on any inactive unit.
11. Runs `deploy_state.py handover` (reports doc staleness, never blocks).
12. Compares the running `/opt/data/deploy-hermes.sh` with the
    `deploy/hermes-deploy.sh` it just pulled and prints `DEPLOY TOOL STALE`
    with the `install` line to fix it. **The deploy tool does not deploy
    itself** — the copy on the box is installed by hand, so a merged change to
    this script does nothing until someone installs it, and the deploy reports
    success meanwhile (it did, for #292). It is reported and not self-applied:
    a script that overwrites itself while bash is still reading it is its own
    class of bug. Silent when the two agree.

A successful deploy ends with `deploy OK (<sha>)` and all 15 services `active`
(14 `hermes-*` plus `agent-home`).

### Common pitfalls

- **Region is `cn-hongkong`, not `cn-shenzhen`.** The instance is in Hong Kong;
  using the wrong region gives `InvalidInstance.NotFound`.
- **The Output field is base64-encoded.** `DescribeInvocationResults` returns
  the script's stdout in `Output` as base64 — decode it before reading. A
  manual copy/paste of the base64 string can corrupt bytes; pipe through
  `python3 -c "import base64; ..."` in one step.
- **`develop` requires pull requests.** A direct `git push origin develop` is
  rejected by a GitHub repository rule. Always branch → PR → merge.
- **vitest passes but `tsc` fails.** vitest uses esbuild (lenient), but the
  deploy script runs `next build` which uses `tsc` (strict). A missing closing
  brace on an interface, for example, passes vitest but fails the deploy build.
  Run `npx tsc --noEmit` in `agent-home/` before pushing if you changed `.ts`/
`.tsx` files.
- **The deploy takes 2-5 minutes.** The `aliyun ecs RunCommand` call returns
  immediately with an `InvokeId`; the script keeps running. Wait at least 120s
  before polling `DescribeInvocationResults`.
