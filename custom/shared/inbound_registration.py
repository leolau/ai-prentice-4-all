"""Shared arrival registration for standalone services (pollers, batcher).

The sibling of :mod:`shared.file_registration`, for the message rather than its
attachments. Standalone services write to the pipeline's own SQLite and never
touch the gateway's ``MessageEvent`` path, so nothing mirrors what arrived into
the shared, principal-scoped store that ``agent-home`` reads. This module is
that mirror: one call beside each existing SQLite insert.

Best-effort, always. If Supabase is unconfigured, the owner principal cannot be
resolved, or Postgres is briefly down, the call returns ``False`` and message
processing continues. A missing registry row is recoverable — ``hermes
incomings backfill`` replays it from the SQLite the poller already wrote. A
dropped message is not recoverable, so nothing here is allowed to raise.
