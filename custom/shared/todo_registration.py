"""Shared to-do registration for standalone services (triage, pollers, cron).

The sibling of :mod:`shared.inbound_registration`, for what should *happen*
about an arrival rather than the arrival itself. Triage runs in its own
process against the pipeline's SQLite and never touches the gateway, so the
judgement it forms — "this one needs an answer by Friday" — dies in a table
nobody looks at. This module is the bridge to the shared, principal-scoped
to-do store that ``agent-home`` reads.

Best-effort, always. If Supabase is unconfigured, the owner principal cannot be
resolved, or Postgres is briefly down, the call returns ``None`` and triage
carries on: a missing to-do costs the user a nudge, while an exception here
would cost them the message.

The plan is ``docs/plans/2026-08-11-001-todos-staging-layer-plan.md``.
