"""Shared file registration for standalone services (email poller, WhatsApp batcher).

Standalone services don't go through the gateway's MessageEvent pipeline, so
the gateway's file registry hook (register_event_files in gateway/inbound_files.py)
never fires for them.  This module bridges that gap by calling
store_and_register() directly, with the principal resolved from the
PrincipalStore (the owner for a personal agent).

The registration is best-effort: if Supabase is unconfigured, the principal
can't be resolved, or anything else goes wrong, the call returns False and
the message-processing continues uninterrupted.  A missing registry row is
recoverable by a backfill; a dropped message is not.
