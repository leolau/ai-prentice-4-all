"""The shared tag vocabulary: one set of tags across every kind of thing.

Tagging shipped first for chat sessions (``session_tags`` / ``session_tag_map``
in :mod:`hermes_state`, schema v18) — named, coloured tags with tri-state
include/exclude filtering and LLM suggestions. That design is right and this
module does not replace it; it **moves** it, for one reason: those tables live
in the per-box session SQLite with no ``owner_user_id`` or ``visibility``,
while the things users now want to tag (inbound items, files, tasks) live in
the shared Postgres app schema under row-level security. A tag table in one
store cannot label rows in the other without dual-writing across two databases,
which is exactly the split-brain the storage rules forbid.

So the vocabulary moves to Postgres under contract C2, and the assignment
becomes polymorphic — ``(entity_kind, entity_id)`` rather than ``session_id``
— so one vocabulary, one set of colours and one filter UI serve sessions,
incomings and anything added later. Session tagging keeps working through the
same endpoints; :func:`migrate_session_tags` moves the existing rows once.

Two deliberate asymmetries with :mod:`hermes_cli.file_registry`:

* ``entity_id`` is ``TEXT``, not ``UUID``, and carries no foreign key. Session
  ids are hex strings, not UUIDs, and a polymorphic reference cannot be
  constrained to one parent table anyway. The cost is that deletion cleanup is
  the owning registry's job — see :func:`purge_entity`.
* ``tag_assignments`` has no RLS policy of its own. It is reachable only
  through a scoped join to its parent tag, the same shape FG-04 uses for goal
  metrics, so a tag nobody can read has assignments nobody can read.
