"""FG-28 console scope — the per-request chokepoint for the multi-profile
admin console.

Under the one-process decision (FG-28 §"Architecture decision"), every
console-routed request enters its target profile's scope (HERMES_HOME + secret
scope) at ONE chokepoint before any resolution runs, and the principal is
re-resolved there from the target profile's own ``principals`` table. The
profile picker is a routing hint, never a grant: no row in the target profile
is a 409 regardless of what the caller holds elsewhere, and a suspended
enrolment is a 403. Owner-fallback is refused on these routes — no verified
subject is a 401, never the enrolled owner — because in one process the hop
looks like a function call rather than a service call, so a missing identity is
not conspicuous enough to be caught any other way.

This module is the **fastapi-free, unit-testable core**. ``web_server`` wires it
as a dependency that reads ``?profile=<name>`` (defaulting to the active profile
when absent, so single-profile consoles are byte-identical). The hard
security property — authority re-derived in the target profile's scope, not
asserted by the routing layer — lives here, behind a ``store_factory`` the
tests inject with a synthetic :class:`PrincipalStore`.
