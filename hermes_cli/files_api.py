"""HTTP routes for the inbound file registry.

The read/serve surface over ``file_assets``: what arrived, from where, and a
short-lived link to the bytes. Every endpoint resolves the C1 principal and
scopes to that principal's visible set — the registry must not be an easier way
to read somebody's private material than the memory tier is.

Two things this deliberately does not do. It never returns a filesystem path:
the bytes live in a private bucket and a browser reaches them only through a
signed URL minted after an ownership check. And it never ingests: a file
appearing here is a record of arrival, not a decision to remember it.

Mounted by ``web_server.py`` beside the memory explorer router.
