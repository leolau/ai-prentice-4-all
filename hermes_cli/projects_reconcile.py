"""Projects-side reconciliation: card-settlement refill (Gap A) and the
open-run sweep — capacity top-up + staleness (Gap B) (FG-32).

See ``plans/2026-09-13-project-run-resilience-plan.md`` for the incident and
design this module implements.

``projects_run.promote_run_cards()`` — the only thing that moves a run's
``triage`` cards into ``todo`` under the project's ``max_in_progress`` cap
(§4.1) — is otherwise called from exactly two places: ``start_run()`` and
the human ``continue_run()`` action. Nothing re-invokes it when a card the
run is waiting on finishes, fails, or blocks and a slot frees up, so a run
whose cap is smaller than its playbook (the default, ``max_in_progress=1``)
promotes its first batch and then stalls forever with no human action —
independent of any process restart.

``on_card_settled()`` is the completion-side fix (Gap A): called from
``kanban_db`` right after a run-linked card leaves ``running``/``ready``
(done, blocked, or a dependency wait), it looks up the owning run and, if
still ``running``, tops up its promoted cards via
``projects_run.refill_run_cards()`` — the same promotion the run started
with, minus forcing past a held checkpoint, which stays ``continue_run()``'s
human act.

``reconcile_all_open_runs()`` is the periodic sweep (Gap B): a card
completion is exactly the event a process restart can lose (the worker
finished and called back into a process that no longer exists, or never
even started because the restart landed before any card left ``triage``).
The sweep re-drives the same refill on every open run on an interval,
independent of any single event firing, and fails a run loudly — closing it
and raising an FG-10 approval — once it has been ``running`` with no card or
session activity for longer than ``projects.run_stall_seconds`` and there is
nothing left to promote or in flight. A run must never silently claim
``running`` past the point it can actually progress (§6).

This module is imported lazily from ``kanban_db.py`` (never at module load
time) so the generic kanban store keeps knowing nothing about Projects
beyond "does this task carry a ``project_id``" — the same layering the rest
of FG-32 already holds to (``kanban_db`` is the shared dispatch substrate;
Projects is a consumer, never a patch to it).
