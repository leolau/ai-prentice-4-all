"""Shared kanban board aggregation — the one rollup every surface renders.

Extracted from ``plugins/kanban/dashboard/plugin_api.py``'s ``GET /board``
(Projects design §12 "One shared rollup helper", step 2). The dashboard
plugin and — later — the Projects router (``GET /{slug}/board``) both
build their board view through :func:`build_board_view` so two surfaces
can never disagree about what "progress" means.

Pure read path: no writes, no connection lifecycle. The caller owns the
``sqlite3.Connection`` (a ``kanban_db.connect()`` handle) and closes it.
