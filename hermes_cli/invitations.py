"""FG-26 — single-use, short-lived invitation tokens for account activation.

An invitation is how somebody the owner/admin just created gets a password:
the admin hands over one link, the invitee opens it and sets their own
password. It replaces the browser-generated temporary password the Users
console used to relay by hand, which meant an admin-chosen secret travelled
through a chat window and stayed valid until someone changed it.

What that costs, and how it is paid for here:

* The token is 32 random bytes (:func:`mint_token`) and **only its SHA-256
  hash is stored** — a database leak yields hashes, and a hash cannot activate
  an account. The raw token exists in exactly one response body, once.
* It is **single-use**: redemption is an atomic ``UPDATE ... RETURNING`` that
  claims the row, so two concurrent redeems cannot both win. A redeem whose
  account operation then fails releases the claim rather than burning the link.
* It is **short-lived** (``invitations.ttl_seconds`` in ``config.yaml``,
  default 300s) and **revocable**, and minting a new one for the same person
  revokes their earlier open invitations — a regenerated link must invalidate
  the one that leaked, not sit alongside it.
* Verification is a hash lookup plus :func:`hmac.compare_digest` on the stored
  digest, so a token that collides on the index still has to match in constant
  time.
* Every lookup failure returns ``None``. The caller cannot distinguish
  "unknown", "expired", "used" or "revoked", which is what keeps the
  unauthenticated redeem endpoint from being an existence oracle.

The table lives in the **administered profile's** schema (FG-27), so an
invitation is scoped to the profile it enrols into even though the GoTrue
account it activates is box-wide.
