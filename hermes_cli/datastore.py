"""Mode- and profile-aware datastore routing for Hermes core and app state.

The SQLite core store is isolated by construction: it lives inside the
profile's ``HERMES_HOME``.  The Supabase app store is not — every profile
resolves the *same* DSN (one Supabase instance per box is the intended
topology), so the schema name is the only discriminator.  A fixed
``app_prod`` would therefore merge every profile's ``principals``,
``memories`` and ``changes`` into one set, and interleaved rows carry no
provenance column, so they cannot be separated afterwards.

:func:`app_schema` derives the schema from the active profile instead
(``app_prod`` for the default profile — byte-identical to the pre-FG-27 name,
so existing deployments are untouched — and ``app_prod_<profile>`` otherwise).
