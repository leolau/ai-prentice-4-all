"""``hermes member`` — owner/admin management of additional brain members (C1).

Create a member (GoTrue account → enrolled principal), list members, change a
member's role, hand out an activation/reset link, and deactivate/reactivate an
enrolment. Runs on the box as the operator, acting as the enrolled **owner** —
the member-management authority (owner or admin) that
:func:`require_member_admin` requires. Ownership itself is managed separately by
``hermes owner``.

FG-26 moved password issuance off this surface: ``member add`` creates a banned
account with a random password and prints a one-time activation link the person
redeems themselves, and ``member invite`` regenerates that link when the short
window lapses. The operator never sees or relays a password.

The GoTrue base url comes from ``dashboard.supabase_auth`` / the ``SUPABASE_*``
env vars; the service-role key is read from the environment only (a credential).
