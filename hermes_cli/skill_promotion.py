"""Moving one distilled skill across the profile boundary. Nothing else.

Hermes already learns: ``background_review`` distils a session into a skill and
the curator keeps the collection tidy. What it cannot do is let a profile
benefit from what another profile learned, because profiles are isolated
schemas and directories by design. That single missing step — *promotion* — is
all this module implements. There is deliberately no new "insights" pipeline
here; the candidate is an ordinary skill that already exists on disk.

Four properties, each of which is a decision the owner already made:

* **Scored, not shouted.** A candidate is quantified from evidence that already
  exists (usage telemetry, and the measured progress of the goal it was
  proposed against). Below the threshold it is stored and never surfaced. The
  review is a weekly digest, because a promotion is never urgent and an
  interrupt would be paid for by whoever is mid-task.
* **Capped, therefore competitive.** Shared skills are listed in the stable
  prompt of *every* profile, so an unbounded shared library taxes every turn
  everywhere. At the cap a newcomer is promoted only by displacing a strictly
  weaker resident, and a resident nobody uses becomes a demotion candidate.
* **Two stages, one code path.** The origin profile's reviewer approves first —
  only they can tell whether a skill carries traces of the people who taught
  it — and the owner approves second, because only they can say it belongs to
  the whole entity. There is no auto-approval branch, not even for a
  single-principal install: a minute a week is cheaper than a second code path
  that can approve on its own.
* **Exact reviewed bytes.** The proposal records a hash of the body that was
  reviewed. Approval re-reads the file and refuses on mismatch, so "approved"
  always means the text somebody actually read.

The shared tier stays unreachable to autonomous curation: it lives under
``skills.external_dirs``, which
:func:`agent.skill_utils.is_external_skill_path` already makes read-only to the
curator. This module writes it, the curator cannot, and that asymmetry *is* the
audited path.
