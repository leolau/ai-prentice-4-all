"""Multi-user access model for the single shared Hermes brain (contracts C1, C2).

This module publishes the two Wave-0 access contracts consumed by later
feature groups (memory, skills, goals, tasks, tools, assets):

* **C1 — principal/identity.** :class:`Principal` binds a system ``user_id`` to
  a single :data:`Role` (``owner`` | ``admin`` | ``member`` | ``viewer``) plus
  the channel identities that map to it. :func:`resolve_principal` is the
  gateway seam that turns an inbound channel identity into a principal, reusing
  ``gateway/pairing.py`` for enrolment. Identities are backed by self-hosted
  Supabase: ``principals.user_id`` **is** the GoTrue subject id, and the
  ``channel_identities`` table maps ``(platform, channel_user_id)`` onto it.

* **C2 — visibility/scoping.** Every scoped row carries ``owner_user_id`` and a
  ``visibility`` of either :data:`SHARED` (readable by all members) or
  ``private:<user_id>`` (readable only by that user). :func:`can_read` and
  :func:`scope_filter` are the app-layer filter; :func:`apply_scope_rls`
  installs the equivalent **Postgres row-level security** so the boundary is
  enforced at the database and cannot be bypassed from the app layer. The owner
  role bypasses the filter and sees everything.

  **Per-item grants (FG-19).** On top of shared/private, a row may be
  *granted* to specific users through the :data:`ITEM_GRANTS_TABLE` — a
  cross-user assignment that does **not** downgrade the row's visibility (the
  owner's *other* private rows stay hidden). :func:`scope_filter` and
  :func:`apply_scope_rls` take an optional ``grant_item_kind`` so a
  grant-scoped table (a GTS goal/task) additionally reads a row when an active
  (``pending``/``accepted``) grant to the requesting principal exists for that
  exact item. This is a narrow extension of the existing C2 helpers, not a
  second access system.

Datastore routing always goes through contract C3
(:func:`hermes_cli.datastore.get_store`) — this module never opens a raw
connection or re-implements mode routing.
