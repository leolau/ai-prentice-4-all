"""FG-26 — audit trail for identity administration (C5 change + C8 span).

Every act of the Users console that changes who exists, what they may do, or
whether they can log in is recorded twice, because the two ledgers answer
different questions: the C5 ``changes`` log is the durable "what was done to
this user, by whom" record the console's activity view reads, and the C8
``interactions`` span puts the same act on the operational timeline next to the
requests around it.

Two rules this module exists to enforce in one place rather than at each call
site:

* **No raw invitation token, ever.** A token in an audit payload would outlive
  the 5-minute window and turn the audit trail into a credential store, so
  payloads are filtered (:func:`_safe_payload`) rather than trusted.
* **Auditing never fails the operation.** The user was created; refusing to
  report success because the ledger was unreachable would leave the caller
  believing nothing happened. Failures are logged and swallowed.
