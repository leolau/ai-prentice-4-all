"""Member management (PR-3) — GoTrue admin create → principal enrolment.

The owner/admin surface for onboarding and managing additional members of the
shared Hermes brain. A "member" is a Supabase Auth (GoTrue) account whose
subject UUID is enrolled as a :class:`~hermes_cli.access.Principal`, so the same
identity that logs in (via the ``supabase`` dashboard-auth provider) is the one
the multi-user RLS layer scopes data to.

Two collaborators, kept apart on purpose:

* :class:`GoTrueAdminClient` owns the account system — it calls GoTrue's
  **admin** endpoints (``/auth/v1/admin/users``) with the *service-role* key to
  create accounts, set/reset passwords, and ban/unban (deactivate/reactivate).
  It never touches Hermes state and never logs a secret or a password.
* :class:`MemberService` orchestrates: it authorises the actor (owner/admin
  only), drives the GoTrue account operation, and mirrors it into the
  :class:`~hermes_cli.access.PrincipalStore` (enrol / set-role). Account
  creation is transactional-ish: if enrolment fails after the GoTrue user is
  created, the GoTrue user is rolled back so a half-created member can't linger.

**Why the service-role key is env-only.** It can mint and delete any account,
so it is a credential — it lives in ``~/.hermes/.env`` (or the process env),
never in ``config.yaml`` and never in a browser. Only server-side code
(this module, the CLI, the owner/admin-guarded API) ever holds it.

**Signup stays closed.** This module is the *only* way accounts are created;
open self-signup is disabled at the GoTrue server
(``GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true``). New members always come through an
owner/admin here.

**FG-26 — what changed, and why.** Creation used to take a password chosen in
the browser and hand it to the admin to relay. Now the account is created
**banned, with a server-generated random password nobody sees**, and the admin
hands over a single-use :mod:`hermes_cli.invitations` link on which the invitee
sets their own password (which is also what unbans them). Three consequences
fall out of the shared-Supabase topology that FG-27 made explicit — all
profiles share one GoTrue, so an *account* is box-wide while *authority* is
per profile:

* An email that already has an account is an **enrolment**, not a conflict:
  somebody joining their second profile gets a ``principals`` row, no
  invitation, and their existing password untouched.
* Creation validates the requested ``profile`` **before** it calls GoTrue, so a
  refusal cannot leave an orphan account behind (FG-28 owns cross-profile
  assignment).
* "Deactivate" is a *per-profile* verb (``principals.active``), not a GoTrue
  ban: banning the shared account would evict the person from every other
  profile at once.
