"""Google Drive → layer-4 RAG ingestion (FG-21 P4).

Scope is *all of Drive*, per the deployment's decision: everything each
configured account can open, "Shared with me" included. Two consequences shape
this module, and both are deliberate:

**Ingestion is newest-first and resumable.** A full backfill of an established
Drive account is hours of embedding on a 4-vCPU box shared with the gateway, so
a run takes a ``--limit`` and walks ``modifiedTime desc``. The tenders you are
working on this week become searchable in the first minute; the 2019 archive
arrives over subsequent runs. A run that dies halfway leaves every document it
finished, and the next run skips them by content hash.

**Ingested documents stay private to the person who ingested them.** A file
shared with an account is not a file the whole instance may read, so every
document lands on ``private:<owner>`` and reaches another person only by the
same two mechanisms as memory: a downward role read, or an explicit grant. There
is deliberately no "ingest as shared" switch here — laundering someone's private
contract into instance-wide visibility would be silent and irreversible.

Credentials are the files the Google Workspace MCP server already stores per
account (``<email>.json``: refresh token, client id/secret, scopes), so
ingestion needs no new secret and no new consent screen. It reads with the
``drive.readonly`` scope those files already carry.
