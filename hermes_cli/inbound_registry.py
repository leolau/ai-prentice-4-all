"""The inbound item registry: every arrival, in one place a browser can read.

WhatsApp messages, emails and calendar events all reach Hermes today and all
land somewhere private to the box that received them — the custom pipeline's
SQLite (``whatsapp_data.db``), reachable from MCP tools and the Telegram digest
and nowhere else. ``/inbox`` cannot list them because there is nothing shared
to list: the page shows FG-10 approvals and the FG-12 change log, which is why
it looks empty of the mail that actually arrived.

This table is the missing shared read model. It is deliberately a *projection*,
not a second source of truth: the pipeline keeps owning raw payloads, threading
and triage state in SQLite, and mirrors a normalized, principal-scoped summary
here so a user-facing surface has something durable and RLS-safe to page
through. Nothing here parses a mailbox or talks to an API.

Two design points worth knowing before changing anything:

* **Upsert, not append.** Unlike :mod:`hermes_cli.file_registry` — where the
  same file arriving twice is two facts — an email re-polled from IMAP or a
  calendar event that got rescheduled is *one* item that changed. Identity is
  ``(owner_user_id, surface, account_id, external_id)``, so a poller may
  re-register freely and a rescheduled meeting updates in place rather than
  appearing twice.
* **Search is pre-segmented.** ``search_text`` is written by
  :func:`hermes_cli.text_search.searchable`, which expands CJK runs into
  bigrams because Postgres cannot segment Chinese and would otherwise index a
  whole sentence as one lexeme. The tsvector is generated from *that* column,
  never from ``body`` directly — see that module for the full reasoning.
