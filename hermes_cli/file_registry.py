"""The inbound file registry: every file that arrives, with its provenance.

A file reaching Hermes today is read once and forgotten — gateway attachments
are cached under ``cache/documents`` and pruned after a day, and agent-home
uploads land in a private Supabase bucket nobody can list. Neither is a record
of *what arrived, from whom, when*.

This module is that record, and it is deliberately **not** memory. Registering
is a fact ("this file arrived"); ingesting it into the RAG tier is a judgement
("this matters"), made later by the user or by a triage skill. Conflating them
is how a corpus fills up with group-chat stickers, so nothing here embeds
anything or writes to ``rag_documents``; it only stores ``document_id`` once
somebody has decided.

Scoping matches the memory tier exactly — contract C2 visibility, per-item
grants and (where enabled) downward role reads — because a registry with weaker
access than memory would be a way to read somebody's private material by asking
a different table for it.
