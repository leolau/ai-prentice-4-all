"""Supabase Storage from Python: put the bytes somewhere durable and private.

agent-home already writes uploads into a private bucket through its BFF; the
gateway side had nowhere to put an attachment except a scratch directory that
is pruned after a day. This is the missing half — the same bucket, the same
key layout, reached over the Storage REST API so the Python side needs no
Supabase SDK.

Reads are never direct: a caller that has already checked the principal may
mint a short-lived signed URL, which is what the browser follows. The bucket
stays private, and an object key is never a capability on its own.
