"""Profile lifecycle: suggest, adopt, retire — an output of the learning loop.

Every other Phase-6 doc assumed an owner can name their sub-goals up front and
create a profile for each. They can't. Sub-goal structure is *discovered by
doing the work*, so profile creation must be an *output* of the same loop that
distils skills and watches where work clusters — not a setup step.

This module is the proposal layer over that loop. It follows the
``skill_promotion.py`` blueprint exactly: ``SCHEMA_SQL``, a frozen dataclass,
an async store taking ``SupabaseAppStore``, ``_audit()`` for C5, and
``digest_lines()`` for plain-text output. Suggestion generation reads evidence
already recorded, uses the aux LLM for dual role/goal naming, and is capped at
one open suggestion at a time. Adoption calls ``create_profile`` and seeds a
profile-tier sub-goal. Retire/merge use the existing export path.

Three properties from the FG-30 spec, each a decision the owner made:

* **Consent-first, never auto-created.** A suggestion is a proposal with
  evidence attached. Only the owner adopts, because a new profile is a change
  to the entity's goal tree. Dismissals are kept and latched on ``dedup_key``,
  so a dismissed suggestion is never re-proposed on the same evidence.
* **Monthly, one at a time.** The digest emits at most one suggestion per
  cycle — a second nudge trains the owner to dismiss without reading.
  Generation is its own monthly pass, skipped while any suggestion is still
  ``proposed``; rendering rides ``weekly_digest()`` so an open suggestion
  appears in every weekly review until it is reviewed.
* **Dual role/goal naming.** Each suggestion carries both ``proposed_role``
  and ``proposed_goal``. The role is for the human; the goal is what the goal
  tree hangs on and what retirement completes — a role has no end state.

its own profile.

You are given evidence: skill clusters, goal patterns, and session topics that
look unlike the current profile's focus. Produce a single JSON object with
exactly these keys:

  - proposed_name: a profile identifier (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens).
  - proposed_role: a role-shaped label. A role is for the human.
  - proposed_goal: the sub-goal. This is mandatory — retirement completes a
