# Implementation status: Project run resilience (refill + restart recovery + doctor)

Companion to `plans/2026-09-13-project-run-resilience-plan.md`. Update this
file as work lands — one row per gap, per the plan's §7 breakdown.

| # | Gap | Description | Status | PR / commit | Notes |
|---|-----|-------------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | A | `refill_run_cards()` + `projects_reconcile.on_card_settled()` refill hook (kanban_db → projects_reconcile → projects_run on card settle) | **Done** | [#388](https://github.com/leolau/ai-prentice-4-all/pull/388) | See "Gap A implementation notes" below |
| 2 | B | `reconcile_all_open_runs()` + `run_stall_seconds`/`reconcile_interval_seconds` config + gateway watcher wiring + auto-fail stale runs | **Not started** | — | Depends on #1's `reconcile_run()` |
| 3 | C | `doctor_findings`/`derive_health` `run_stalled` code (all cadences) | **Not started** | — | Read-only, can ship independently |
| 4 | — | FG-32 §20.2 pointer to this defect + plan doc | **Not started** | — | Do after #1–#3 merge |
| 5 | — | Tests (unit: refill, reconcile, doctor; gateway watcher interval; E2E full-run-without-manual-continue) | **Not started** | — | Written alongside each of #1–#3, per plan §5 |
| 6 | — | Production cleanup: orphaned run `run_91b11d845e73` on `ai-professsional-builder-course-ppt` | **Not started** | — | Expected to self-resolve once #2 deploys; manual triage only if it doesn't |

## Investigation record (already done, 2026-09-13)

- Confirmed on the Hetzner production box (`188.245.219.105`) via
  `hermes projects list/runs/cards --json`:
  - Run `run_91b11d845e73` (project `ai-professsional-builder-course-ppt`,
    run #1) started `2026-09-12 04:46:58 UTC`, still `status: running` as of
    `2026-09-12 18:37 UTC` (~13.8h), `session_id: null`, 0/7 cards ever
    started.
  - `hermes projects doctor --json` returned `{"items": []}` — confirms Gap C.
  - `systemctl show <unit> -p ActiveEnterTimestamp` for `hermes-gateway`,
    `hermes-dashboard`, `agent-home`, `hermes-embed`, `hermes-email-poller`,
    `hermes-calendar-poller` all show `2026-09-12 06:03:2x/40 UTC` — a
    bulk restart of every `hermes-*` service ~1h16m into the run, with no
    matching `/opt/data/deploy-*.log` entry (not the reviewed deploy tool).
    `last -x` shows the colocated `aicoder` tmux session ending at the same
    timestamp.
- Read `hermes_cli/projects_run.py` end to end: confirmed `promote_run_cards()`
  is called only from `start_run()` and `continue_run()` — no completion hook
  re-invokes it (Gap A, independent of the restart).
- Read `hermes_cli/projects_schedule.py` `doctor_findings()`/`derive_health()`
  end to end: confirmed no code path inspects a `running` run's age or
  activity for any cadence (Gap C).
- Read `gateway/kanban_watchers.py::_kanban_dispatcher_watcher`: confirmed
  this is the existing periodic-tick loop the fix should extend (Gap B call
  site), rather than adding a new service/loop.

## Gap A implementation notes (deviations from the plan's §3.1 sketch)

- `refill_run_cards(pconn, bconn, *, project, run)` landed in
  `hermes_cli/projects_run.py` (not a separate function named
  `reconcile_run` — folded straight into the module `promote_run_cards`
  already lives in, since it's a thin wrapper around it, mirroring
  `continue_run()`'s own playbook/held setup almost verbatim).
- The completion-side hook is `hermes_cli/projects_reconcile.py`
  (`on_card_settled(bconn, task_id)`), called from a new
  `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py::_reconcile_project_run_capacity(conn, task_id)`
  helper — added right after each of the 3 existing
  `_fire_kanban_lifecycle_hook("kanban_task_completed"/"kanban_task_blocked",
  ...)` call sites (`complete_task`, and both exits of `block_task`:
  the `dependency`-kind early return and the shared blocked/triage-loop
  path). This covers every place a run-linked card leaves
  `running`/`ready` — confirmed by reading all `_fire_kanban_lifecycle_hook`
  call sites rather than assuming.
- Deliberately **not** wired through the plugin `invoke_hook`/`register_hook`
  mechanism in `hermes_cli/plugins.py` — that system is for third-party
  plugins reaching into core (see `website/docs/guides/build-a-hermes-plugin.md`);
  no other core-internal consumer uses it today, and using it here would
  invert that layering. Direct lazy-imported function call instead, matching
  the existing pattern right next to it (`_fire_kanban_lifecycle_hook` itself
  lazy-imports `hermes_cli.plugins`).
- `projects_db.get_run_card_by_task(conn, task_id)` added as the reverse
  lookup (`project_run_cards` has no `task_id` index by design — a full
  table isn't expected to need one at this scale, matches the existing
  `get_run_cards` query style).
- Tests added directly to `tests/hermes_cli/test_projects_run.py` (no new
  test file) in the existing §4/`max_in_progress` section:
  `test_completing_a_card_auto_promotes_the_next_one` (the real
  regression — exercises `kanban_db.complete_task()` end to end, the
  actual production call path, no mocking of the promotion layer) and
  `test_refill_run_cards_is_a_noop_off_a_running_run` (never forces a held
  checkpoint open; no-ops on a closed run).
  - Discovered along the way: `project_run_cards` rows come back from
    `get_run_cards()` sorted by `task_id` (its primary key), not playbook
    order — harmless for steps with real `depends_on` edges (those still
    gate correctly) but means "first card promoted" among mutually
    independent steps is arbitrary. Not in scope for this fix; the test
    was written to not assume a specific step is promoted first.
- Verified no regressions: built a throwaway local venv (Python 3.12,
  `pip install -e .`), ran `tests/hermes_cli/test_projects_run.py` (39
  passed) and the full `test_kanban_*.py` + `test_projects_*.py` sweep
  (973 passed, 25 failed) — then confirmed via `git stash` that the exact
  same 25 tests fail identically on unmodified `develop` (pre-existing
  environment gaps, e.g. a subprocess CLI test needing `asyncpg`, unrelated
  to this change).
- Shipped as its own PR ([#388](https://github.com/leolau/ai-prentice-4-all/pull/388)),
  separate from this plan's docs-only PR ([#387](https://github.com/leolau/ai-prentice-4-all/pull/387)),
  since #387 was explicitly "docs only, no behavior change."

## How to update this file

When a PR for one of the rows above merges to `develop`:
1. Flip its Status to `Done` and fill in the PR link.
2. If the change altered the design (e.g. a different config default, a
   different call site than planned), add a short note in that row rather
   than editing the plan doc's prose — the plan doc stays the original
   design record; this file is the diff against it.
3. If a row is abandoned or superseded, mark it `Dropped` with a one-line
   reason, don't delete it.
