"""Capture, render and audit the deployment state that git does not hold.

A long-lived Hermes deployment is more than its checkout. On the systest box
the checkout is 100% reproducible from `develop`, while everything that makes
it *that* deployment lives only on the disk:

    config.yaml          10 MCP servers, approval gates, model + memory wiring
    .env                 the secrets
    systemd units        the unprivileged `hermes` model, drop-ins, timers
    credential files     Google/WhatsApp/Canva tokens obtained interactively

Rebuild the box and the agent comes back mute. Worse, an edit to any of it —
by an operator, by a deploy step, or by the agent itself acting on a prompt —
leaves no trace anywhere a reviewer would look.

This script closes that gap without pretending the repo can own the file:

    capture   sanitize the live state into the repo, secrets replaced by
              ${PLACEHOLDER}. Review it as a PR. This is the normal loop.
              --secrets-out writes the values to a root-owned file so the
              rebuild path has something to render from.

    render    snapshot + a root-owned secrets file -> a real config.yaml.
              Used when rebuilding a box, never on a schedule.
    check     diff the live state against the committed snapshot and report.
              Never writes. Wired into the weekly drift timer.

`check` is deliberately read-only, because Hermes itself rewrites config.yaml
(`/model` from Telegram, `hermes tools`, memory setup — ~30 call sites). A
scheme that treated the repo as authoritative and overwrote the file would
silently discard changes made from a phone. So the repo holds the reviewed
baseline, the box stays authoritative, and divergence becomes a report.

Where the captured state is kept is a separate decision from where this tool
lives. `--state-root` defaults to `deploy/` in this checkout, which is right
for a private repo; point it at a private clone when the repo holding the
tooling is public. A snapshot contains no credentials, but it does describe a
box in detail — account names, service layout, which identities are enrolled.

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 drift found, 2 the state could not be read.

Usage:
  python scripts/deploy_state.py capture --deployment hermes-systest \
      --hermes-home /opt/data/hermes-home-staging --state-root /opt/data/deploy/state
  python scripts/deploy_state.py render  --deployment hermes-systest \
      --secrets /opt/data/deploy/state-secrets.env --out /tmp/config.yaml
  python scripts/deploy_state.py check   --deployment hermes-systest [--json]
