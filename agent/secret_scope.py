"""Profile-scoped credential resolution for multi-profile gateway multiplexing.

The multiplexing gateway serves many profiles from one process. Each profile
has its own ``.env`` with its own provider keys and platform tokens, so we
**cannot** union them into the process-global ``os.environ`` (that would leak
profile A's keys to profile B's turns, and to every subprocess spawned with
``env=dict(os.environ)``).

This module provides a fail-closed, context-local secret scope:

- ``set_secret_scope(mapping)`` installs the active profile's secrets for the
  current task (a contextvar, so it propagates into the agent's worker thread
  via ``copy_context()`` exactly like the HERMES_HOME override).
- ``get_secret(name)`` reads from that scope. When multiplexing is **active**
  and no scope is set, it RAISES rather than silently falling back to
  ``os.environ`` — an un-migrated or newly-added call site fails loud at that
  exact line instead of leaking another profile's value. When multiplexing is
  **off** (the default), it transparently reads ``os.environ`` so the
  single-profile gateway and every non-gateway caller behave exactly as before.

Design rationale lives in ``docs/design/multiplexing-gateway.md`` (Workstream A).
