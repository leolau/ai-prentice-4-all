"""Live queryable memory tier backed by Supabase Postgres + pgvector.

This is the *live* half of the D2 hybrid memory model. Where the curated tier
(``tools/memory_tool.py``) is a frozen ``MEMORY.md``/``USER.md`` snapshot loaded
once at session start, this store is read and written **mid-turn via tool
calls** — never spliced into the system prompt — so a fact learned this turn is
recallable immediately without disturbing the cached prompt prefix.

Every row is visibility-scoped by contract **C2**
(:mod:`hermes_cli.access`): it carries ``owner_user_id`` + ``visibility``
(``shared`` or ``private:<user_id>``), reads are filtered by
:func:`~hermes_cli.access.scope_filter`, and Postgres **row-level security**
(:func:`~hermes_cli.access.apply_scope_rls`) is the database-level backstop.
All connections are obtained through contract **C3**
(:class:`hermes_cli.datastore.SupabaseAppStore`), so the ``app_dev`` / ``app_prod``
schema follows the resolved mode. Concurrency across many ``(user, task)``
sessions rides Postgres MVCC — each write is its own transaction on its own
connection, so there is no single-writer bottleneck.
