# Multi-User / Member Enablement — Handoff

Handoff for another agent (or a returning human) picking up the multi-user work
on the shared Hermes brain. Captures the agreed plan, what has shipped, and the
production rollout — which is now **complete and verified in production**
(2026-07-27; see "Production rollout — COMPLETED" below). All five requests
(a–e) plus the step-7 DB-role hardening are shipped, deployed, and E2E-tested.

- **Repo:** `leolau/ai-prentice-4-all`
- **Base branch:** `develop`
- **Owner deployment (production):** host `hermes-systest`
  - agent-home: `https://home.leolau.ai-and-i.io` (Next.js, local `127.0.0.1:3100`)
  - dashboard/operator console: `https://leolau.ai-and-i.io` (Python API `127.0.0.1:9119`)
  - self-hosted Supabase stack on-box (GoTrue `supabase-auth`, `supabase-storage`,
    `supabase-rest`, `supabase-kong`, `supabase-db`) — all healthy.
- **Full original plan:** the PR-by-PR plan, decisions, and risk notes live below
  and in each merged PR description.

## The five requests (a–e)

From the owner:

> a) Each additional member has access right, could start with least-privilege
>    non-BYPASSRLS DB role, but can be configured by the owner;
> b) wire dashboard/agent-home login to resolve the logged-in user to their own
>    principal instead of always the owner;
> c) Configure Supabase to do password (encrypted) as login provider;
> d) switch the media bucket to private/signed URLs so that each user/member has
>    their own sub-buckets;
> e) an UI in the agent-home to create and manage users/members;

## Decisions locked in (do not re-litigate)

1. **Owner identity:** alias-map the owner's Supabase `sub` (UUID) → existing
   `leo_owner` principal. **No re-keying** of historical rows.
2. **Who manages members:** **owner + admin** (roles ordered `owner > admin >
   member > viewer`). The member-management path never grants/mutates `owner`;
   ownership only moves via `hermes owner transfer`.
3. **Onboarding:** owner sets a **temporary password** and hands it over. No SMTP
   / invite emails.
4. **Rollout:** the DB-role switch (PR-1's serving role) is done in a
   **maintenance window**, verifying background services before/after.
5. **Packaging:** **5-PR split**, reviewed/merged/deployed independently.

## Status at a glance

| PR | Scope | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| **PR-1** #55 | Security foundation (a+b): non-BYPASSRLS `hermes_app` role, admin-DSN split, `bind_principal` per request, `_comms_resolve_principal` identity binding, owner alias map, ensure-RLS, real-path DB RLS tests | **merged** |
| **PR-2** #56 | Supabase (GoTrue) email/password dashboard-auth provider (c): password grant, local JWT verify, `sub`→principal, closed signup | **merged** |
| **PR-3** #57 | Member-management backend (e-backend): `/api/comms/members` API + `hermes member` CLI, GoTrue admin create → enroll principal, owner/admin guard | **merged** |
| **PR-4** #58 | agent-home Members management UI (e-frontend): owner/admin screen + BFF routes | **merged** |
| **PR-5** #60 (+lint #61) | Private media bucket + signed URLs (d): no public URLs, `GET /api/chat/media` signs short-lived URLs after a server-side path-ownership check, transcript carries the object path | **merged** |
| **Step 7** #62 | Crash-safe non-BYPASSRLS `agent_home_app` **login** read-role for agent-home direct reads (`hermes owner read-role`); avoids the event-trigger-faulting membership grant | **merged** |
| **Rollout + isolation verification** | Owner Supabase login enrolled, signup closed, DB-role switched, bucket flipped private, synthetic-member DB+storage isolation proven end-to-end, then cleaned up | **done in prod (2026-07-27)** |

## What already existed (build on it, don't rebuild)

- `DashboardAuthProvider` ABC (`hermes_cli/dashboard_auth/base.py`) — full OAuth +
  password framework. PR-2 added a Supabase provider plugin, not a new stack.
- Auth middleware attaches the verified `Session` (with `user_id` = provider
  subject) to `request.state.session` on every gated request.
- RLS engine (`hermes_cli/access.py`): `apply_scope_rls` / `apply_item_grants_rls`
  / `scope_filter` + `bind_principal()` set `hermes.principal_id` /
  `hermes.principal_role` GUCs. `PrincipalStore.enroll(user_id, role=…)` +
  `link_channel(...)`, roles `owner|admin|member|viewer`.
- agent-home login bridge (`agent-home/src/app/api/session/login`,
  `src/lib/auth/principal.ts`): `POST /auth/password-login` → capture token →
  `/api/comms/whoami` → signed cookie with the principal snapshot.
- The two things that made RLS *inert* before PR-1 (both fixed there): the app
  connected as a `BYPASSRLS` role (`postgres`), and `bind_principal()` was never
  called on a live request connection.

## PR-4 (this branch) — what was built

Owner/admin **Members** screen in agent-home + same-origin BFF routes. The
browser only ever calls same-origin `/api/comms/members[...]`; those Next.js
route handlers forward to the merged Python `/api/comms/members` API under the
bridged session. The service-role key never reaches the browser.

**Files added / changed (all under `agent-home/`):**

- `src/types/index.ts` — `Member`, `MembersResponse`, `MemberCreateResponse`,
  `MemberRoleResponse`, `MemberOkResponse` (mirror `members.MemberView.as_dict`
  and the PR-3 route envelopes).
- `src/lib/api/client.ts` — typed methods: `members()`, `createMember()`,
  `setMemberRole()`, `setMemberPassword()`, `deactivateMember()`,
  `activateMember()`.
- `src/lib/api/member-bff.ts` — shared `requireMemberAdmin()` (401 unauth / 403
  non-admin → owner/admin client) + `forwardMemberError()` (maps
  `HermesApiError` status, else 502).
- `src/app/api/comms/members/route.ts` — `GET` (list) + `POST` (create).
- `src/app/api/comms/members/[userId]/role/route.ts` — `PUT` role.
- `src/app/api/comms/members/[userId]/password/route.ts` — `POST` reset password.
- `src/app/api/comms/members/[userId]/deactivate/route.ts` — `POST` deactivate.
- `src/app/api/comms/members/[userId]/activate/route.ts` — `POST` reactivate.
- `src/components/members/MembersView.tsx` — interactive client screen: add-member
  form (email, display, role select `admin|member|viewer`, temp-password with a
  Generate button), member list with per-row role select, reset-password,
  deactivate/reactivate. Owner row is **read-only** (note points to
  `hermes owner transfer`). Temp passwords are surfaced exactly once from what the
  browser just set — never fetched back or persisted.
- `src/app/members/page.tsx` — server component; `requirePrincipal()` + hard
  owner/admin gate (member/viewer → not-authorized card), loads the roster into
  `MembersView` inside the existing responsive `MobileShell`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — role-gated **Members** link on Home (owner/admin only).
- Tests: `src/lib/api/client.members.test.ts` (BFF forwarding: paths, methods,
  bodies, token replay) and `src/components/members/MembersView.test.tsx` (owner
  read-only, member controls, deactivated state, empty/not-configured).

**Authorization is enforced twice:** the BFF rejects non-admins early for clean
UX; the Python layer enforces owner/admin independently as the real boundary
(a forged/direct request still gets 403 upstream). The BFF gate is a UX
convenience, **not** the security boundary.

**data-component:** every new/modified component root carries a
`data-component="…"` attribute (per repo knowledge note).

### Backend response shapes PR-4 depends on (from PR-3, merged)

- `GET  /api/comms/members` → `{ configured, members: [{ user_id, display, role, email, active, channels, is_owner }] }`
- `POST /api/comms/members` → `{ ok, member: { user_id, display, role } }`
- `PUT  /api/comms/members/{id}/role` → `{ ok, member: { user_id, role } }`
- `POST /api/comms/members/{id}/password` → `{ ok }`
- `POST /api/comms/members/{id}/deactivate|activate` → `{ ok, active }`

`MemberView.as_dict` lives in `hermes_cli/members.py`; the routes in
`hermes_cli/web_server.py` (`@app.get/post/put("/api/comms/members…")`, ~line
3221+). `ASSIGNABLE_ROLES = ("admin", "member", "viewer")` — never `owner`.

## PR-5 — code landed (this branch)

Item (d), code half. What shipped:

1. `getPublicUrl` is **gone**. `uploadChatMedia` returns only the object `path`
   (`ChatAttachment.url` removed from the shared type).
2. `canReadMediaPath(principal, path)` — fail-closed path-ownership check: plain
   relative key, every segment slug-clean, first segment `=== slug(user_id)`.
   **Own-only for every role**, owner/admin included (documented deviation from
   "owner may read broader": fail-closed default, easy to widen later).
3. `createMediaSignedUrl(path, ttl)` + `GET /api/chat/media?path=…` (401 / 400 /
   403 crafted-or-foreign / 404 unsignable / 501 unconfigured). TTL from
   `AGENT_HOME_MEDIA_URL_TTL`, default 60s, clamped 5..3600.
4. Transcript render path: the persisted turn carries
   `![name](/api/chat/media?path=…)` (`lib/chat/media-ref.ts`), and the client
   `ChatMedia` component resolves a signed URL per render. Old transcripts with a
   literal URL still render as a plain `<img>`.
5. `/api/chat/send` drops any client-supplied attachment path outside the
   caller's prefix, so a foreign path never enters history.

**Owner-gated box step — DONE (2026-07-27):** the `agent-home-media` bucket was
flipped **public → private** in the self-hosted Supabase (0 objects at the time,
so zero-risk). Verified on the box: a public object URL returns **400 (denied)**
while a service-role signed URL returns **200**. Optional further hardening
(Storage RLS on `storage.objects` keyed to the authenticated user) is not
required — the BFF path-ownership check (`canReadMediaPath`) + private bucket +
short-lived signed URLs already fail-close cross-principal reads (proven below).

## Production rollout — COMPLETED (2026-07-27)

All owner-gated production steps have been executed on `hermes-systest` and the
full multi-user boundary is verified end-to-end. History (chronological):

1. ✅ **Owner Supabase enrollment:** created the owner GoTrue account for
   `leolau@snappopapp.com` and aliased its `sub` → `leo_owner`
   (`hermes owner alias <uuid>`, targets `app_prod`). Owner data untouched
   (1 principal, 380 interactions preserved throughout).
2. ✅ **Supabase auth provider** configured server-side (`dashboard.supabase_auth`);
   JWT secret + service-role key in the env file, not `config.yaml`. Basic-auth
   login retained as a fallback (no lockout risk).
3. ✅ **Signup closed** at GoTrue (`GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true`).
4. ✅ **DB-role switch (step 7):** agent-home's `DATABASE_URL` repointed from
   `postgres` (BYPASSRLS) → the dedicated **`agent_home_app`** login role
   (`LOGIN NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`, SELECT only on RLS-forced tables).
   Python/migrations/CLI keep the privileged DSN. NOTE: the naive
   `GRANT hermes_app TO CURRENT_USER` membership path faults this Supabase
   build's event trigger — avoided via `grant_membership=False` +
   `hermes owner read-role` (PR #62).
5. ✅ **agent-home redeployed** to `develop` (`db68f75`, PR-5 code) and rebuilt;
   media route + storage.ts present, services healthy.
6. ✅ **Bucket flipped private** (`agent-home-media`; see PR-5 section above).
7. ✅ **End-to-end isolation verified** with a **throwaway synthetic member**,
   then fully removed. Results:

   **DB-level RLS** (connected as `agent_home_app`, principal bound via GUCs,
   real `app_prod.goals` with marked test rows):
   | principal | sees | result |
   |---|---|---|
   | owner | shared + owner-private + member-private | PASS |
   | member | shared + own only (NOT owner-private) | PASS |
   | stranger | shared only | PASS |

   **Storage** (real `GET /api/chat/media`, logged in as the member over HTTPS):
   - member → own object: **200** (signed URL returns the real bytes) — PASS
   - member → owner's object: **403** fail-closed — PASS
   - path-traversal (`../`, embedded `..`): **403** — PASS
   - member own-prefix missing object: **404** (authorized, absent) — PASS
   - unauthenticated: **401** — PASS

   **Cleanup:** member deactivated via `hermes member deactivate` (login then
   blocked, 401), then GoTrue account + principal + seeded rows/objects
   hard-deleted. End state: owner-only principal, 380 interactions intact, 0
   residue, bucket still private, all services active. No secrets printed.

**Onboarding a real member is now fully unblocked** (DB + storage isolation
proven). Use the agent-home Members UI (PR-4) or `hermes member add <email>
--role member` (temp password prompted). The GoTrue admin config the CLI needs
(`SUPABASE_URL` + service-role key) lives in the agent-home env file
(`/opt/data/agent-home-app/agent-home/agent-home.env`), **not** in
`hermes-staging.env` — export both before running the CLI on the box.

Env var names for the service-role key (env-only, never `config.yaml`, never
browser), in precedence order: `HERMES_DASHBOARD_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
`HERMES_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`,
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`.

## How to run / verify PR-4 locally

```bash
cd agent-home
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint (1 pre-existing warning in eslint.config.mjs, 0 errors)
npm run test        # vitest — 86 passing (incl. the new member tests)
npm run build       # next build — all routes incl. /members + the 5 BFF routes
```

Manual: as **owner/admin** open `/members` (or the Home Members link) → add a
member (blank password auto-generates one, shown once), change a role, reset a
password, deactivate/reactivate; each mutation re-reads the list. As a
**member/viewer**, `/members` shows the not-authorized card, the Home link is
hidden, and the API returns 403.

Python side (for PR-3 backend changes): `scripts/run_tests.sh`, plus `ruff` and
`ty` from `/home/ubuntu/.hermes/venvs/hermes-dev/bin/`. Note: this repo has **no
CI checks configured** (0 checks), so verification is local.

## Guardrails (from AGENTS.md + session decisions)

- Preserve prompt caching, strict role alternation, byte-stable system prompt.
- Keep the core narrow; extend at CLI/plugin/service/BFF edges.
- Secrets in env only; behavioral config in `config.yaml`. Never log passwords,
  JWT secrets, access/refresh tokens, or the service-role key. Never send the
  service-role key to the browser. Browser-side authz is never authoritative.
- Add `data-component="ComponentName"` to the root element of every new/modified
  React component (exact PascalCase; don't overwrite an existing one).
- Git: base off `develop`; stage files explicitly (never `git add .`); don't
  amend, force-push protected branches, skip hooks, or run destructive resets.
  Note the four untracked `agent-home/*_TEST_PLAN_*.md` files are intentionally
  left uncommitted.
