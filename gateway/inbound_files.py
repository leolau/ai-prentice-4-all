"""Register channel attachments in the durable file registry.

The gateway caches an inbound attachment under ``cache/documents`` so the model
can read it this turn, and that cache is pruned after a day. This module is the
other half: the same bytes go to the private Supabase bucket and a row records
where they came from — platform, receiving account, conversation, sender,
message and time — which is knowledge only the inbound chokepoint has.

Registering is not remembering. Nothing here embeds anything or touches
``rag_documents``; deciding a file matters is a later, deliberate act by the
user or by a triage skill.
