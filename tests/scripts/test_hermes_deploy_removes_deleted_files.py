"""A deploy that cannot delete leaves the box running code the repo removed.

`git checkout -f <ref> -- .` writes every file the ref *has* and removes nothing
it *lacks*, and the `git reset` after it turns the leftover into an untracked
file. Found on `hermes-systest`: `docs/design/projects-feature-design.md`, still
there — byte-identical to its last committed version — days after the rename
that replaced it. A stale document is the harmless case; a deleted module that
is still importable is the same hole.

The update block is lifted out of the deploy script and run against a real
repository, because the property under test is what git actually does to the
working tree.
