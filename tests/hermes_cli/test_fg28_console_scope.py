"""FG-28 console scope — the per-request chokepoint, unit-tested.

These exercise the fastapi-free core (:mod:`hermes_cli.console_scope`) with a
synthetic :class:`PrincipalStore`, so the security properties hold without a
live Supabase. The real-Postgres negative matrix is the FG-28 E2E on the box
(item 10); here we assert the *invariants* the chokepoint must satisfy
regardless of the store: authority re-derived in the target profile's scope,
owner-fallback refused, the picker never a grant.
