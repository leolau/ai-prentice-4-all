"""Regression test for approval prompt credential redaction (issue #48456).

When Tirith flags a command for containing a credential-shaped pattern, the
gateway approval prompt must redact the credential from the command text
before sending it to the chat platform. Without this fix, the raw command
(with the credential in plaintext) is sent verbatim to Telegram/Discord/etc.,
undoing Tirith's redaction one layer up.

The redaction is wired through the module-level ``_redact_approval_command``
seam. These tests bind that seam -- the production wiring -- not just the
underlying ``redact_sensitive_text`` helper, so they fail if the redaction
call is removed from either approval path.

Credential fixtures are built at runtime from a benign prefix + a run of
``X`` characters (the same trick tests/agent/test_redact.py uses): they match
the redactor regexes so the assertions stay meaningful, but contain no real
or real-looking key, so secret scanners do not flag this file.
"""
