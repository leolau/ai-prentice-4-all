 * was missing everywhere outside Chat:
 *
 * 1. **Says something is happening** — a spinner plus a human label, in an
 *    `aria-live` region so it is announced as well as drawn. On a box with a
 *    lot of records a request can take seconds, and until now the UI simply sat
 *    there looking dead.
 * 2. **Absorbs input** — the overlay covers the region's own controls, so a
 *    second tap on the button you just pressed (or on a neighbouring one)
 *    cannot fire a second request against a half-applied state.
 *
 * It deliberately covers only its region, not the whole viewport: the nav stays
 * reachable, so a slow request can never trap the user on a page.
 *
 * Adoption is one wrapper per view — the views already track a busy boolean,
 * they just never showed it.
