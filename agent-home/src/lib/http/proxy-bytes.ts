/**
 * Stream an upstream object's bytes back to the browser.
 *
 * The signed URLs the Python layer mints point at the Supabase instance as the
 * *server* knows it — on the box that is `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, a loopback
 * address no phone or laptop can ever open, and the bucket is deliberately not
 * exposed publicly. So a redirect to a signed URL is only correct when the
 * browser and the server share a network; here they do not. The BFF fetches the
 * object itself and pipes it, which keeps the signed URL (and the storage host)
 * server-side and works no matter where Supabase lives.
 *
 * Range requests are forwarded and the range headers passed back, because a
 * `<video>`/`<audio>` element seeks with `Range` and a response that answers
 * 200-with-everything makes seeking impossible on some browsers.
