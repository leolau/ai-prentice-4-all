 * placeholder with a new object, so an identity match (`m === live`) silently
 * stops matching after the first delta and the reply is truncated to its first
 * token. Targeting the trailing assistant message by position is stable across
 * those replacements. This is the regression fix for "only shows the first
 * couple of characters then stopped".
