/**
 * Coalescing fetch for the session list (`GET /api/chat/sessions`).
 *
 * Several components refresh the same endpoint independently: the Coral
 * unread badge polls every 45 s *and* fires on `focus` + `visibilitychange`
 * (both fire together on every tab resume), while ChatPane refetches after
 * every mutation. Uncoordinated, a resume can land several identical
 * 200-row queries inside a second — the burst production logs showed.
 *
 * Semantics, keyed by full URL so different filters never collide:
 * - default: join the in-flight request, else reuse a result younger than
 *   FRESH_MS, else fetch. Right for passive readers (badge, wake handlers).
 * - `force: true`: always start a new request — for post-mutation refreshes
 *   that must observe the change, never a response issued before it. The
 *   new request becomes the shared in-flight for later callers.
 *
 * Failures resolve to `null` and keep the last good data; callers treat
 * null as "keep what you have" exactly as they treat a non-OK response.
