/**
 * DELETE /api/comms/members/{userId} — remove an enrolment (**owner only**).
 *
 * `strategy=transfer|purge` is required rather than defaulted, because nothing
 * cascades from `principals` to memories, files or GTS items: without an answer
 * those rows survive with an `owner_user_id` no principal resolves — invisible
 * under C2 and unreachable from any surface. `transfer` also needs
 * `transfer_to`, the principal who inherits them.
 *
 * The box-wide GoTrue account is deliberately **not** deleted: it may serve
 * other profiles on the same Supabase, which is not this console's call.
