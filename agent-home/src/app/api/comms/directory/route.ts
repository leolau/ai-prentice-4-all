 * A member who cannot see who else is in the profile cannot address or delegate
 * to them, so this deliberately has a weaker gate than the management routes —
 * and a correspondingly narrower payload: no email, no ban state, no invitation
 * lifecycle. Upstream builds it from this profile's `principals`, never from the
 * box-wide account table, so it cannot expose people enrolled elsewhere.
