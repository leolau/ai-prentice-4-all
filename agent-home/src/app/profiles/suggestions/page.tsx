/**
 * FG-30 §4.2 T1 — the **Profile suggestions** screen.
 *
 * The FG's actual user-facing surface. Per §4.1 the queue is **profile-local**:
 * `profile_suggestions` FKs profile-local `goals`/`principals`, and FG-28 has
 * not shipped a profile switcher, so this page shows *this* profile's
 * suggestions only — there is no cross-profile view to build here.
 *
 * Any enrolled principal may read the queue (a member can see a proposed
 * sub-goal of the work they are in). Only the owner gets adopt/dismiss; the
 * Python layer is the authority on that, returning 403 for a non-owner — the
 * buttons are hidden here for a clean UX, but the 403 is the real gate, not a
 * BFF re-derivation (the #253 hazard).
